### Observed hardcoded Anthropic model

- Upstream reference: `nanda_adapter/core/agent_bridge.py` at commit `89e8558`
  https://github.com/projnanda/adapter/blob/89e8558158b88f5ef1d08a7b4de08e05f967be14/nanda_adapter/core/agent_bridge.py#L173
- The model is hardcoded to "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", which returned a 404 from Anthropic in my environment.
- Workaround: switching to "claude-3-haiku-20240307" resolved the issue.
- Suggestion: make the model configurable via environment variable or settings to avoid breakage when models are unavailable or renamed.

### NANDA Registry availability issues

- The registry site intermittently failed with: "Error checking user. Please try again." across multiple browsers.
- The subdomain `chat.nanda-registry.com` was not reachable on port `6900` during testing; this likely explains registration failures and sign-in issues observed.
- Action: if registration fails, retry later and/or confirm registry service status. Capture the enrollment link from logs for later use.

### Enrollment link captured

- Enrollment URL: https://chat.nanda-registry.com/landing.html?agentId=agents997004

### Deliverables

- **Nanda Registry proof**: See `out.log` for successful startup and Anthropic call traces, and the enrollment link captured during runs. Enrollment URL (captured): https://chat.nanda-registry.com/landing.html?agentId=agents997004
- **Agent summary and feedback**:
  - The agent is an Enrique persona chat manager that greets users, gathers context, and guides them toward crafting a startup pitch tailored to Enrique as a potential technical coâ€‘founder.
  - Implementation uses CrewAI with `@CrewBase` and YAML persona/task configs (`src/twin_crew/config/agents.yaml`, `src/twin_crew/config/tasks.yaml`), exposed via `create_persona_handler()` in `src/twin_crew/agent/persona_crew.py`. Current scope is persona-only; crew tools will be added later.
  - Adapter integration works; to force our handler path we used the "@local" prefix due to adapter routing. We fixed Anthropic model issues by using a supported Claude model and corrected YAML path resolution. Registry intermittency noted.
  - Feedback: make adapter default to custom improver for local messages (not only @-routed), make model configurable (no hardcoded default), and improve registry reliability.
  - Note: AI assistance was used to improve the readability of `README.md` and this assignment notes document. As well as for most of the coding.
